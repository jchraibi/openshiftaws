=== _DHCP_
DHCP options are setup and attached to the VPC when using the bash script to specify a domain
name. By default, VPC creation with the bash script does include "domain-name = ec2.internal". This
configuration is applied to us-east-1 which is the default location of AWS resources deployed using
the bash scripts. The domain-name is ec2.internal is used by Kubernetes and OpenShift to look up nodes
 and attach EBS storage when applicable. Without this configuration the OpenShift node service is 
unable to start due to the unability to of OpenShift to connect to the AWS to query EC2 instance 
information.
