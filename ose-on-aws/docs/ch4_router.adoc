=== Router

Pods inside of an OpenShift cluster are only reachable via their IP addresses on
the cluster network. An Elastic Load Balanacer and Route53 wildcard entry are 
used to accept traffic from outside networks and proxy the traffic to pods 
inside the OpenShift cluster.

An OpenShift administrator can deploy routers in an OpenShift cluster. These
enable routes created by developers to be used by external clients.

OpenShift routers provide external hostname mapping and load balancing to
services over protocols that pass distinguishing information directly to the
router; the hostname must be present in the protocol in order for the router
to determine where to send it. Routers support the following protocols:

* HTTP
* HTTPS (with SNI)
* WebSockets
* TLS with SNI
