== Reference Implementation

The image below provides a high-level representation of the components within this
reference architecture.  Using Amazon Web Services, resources are highly
available using a combination of multiple availability zones, Elastic Load Balancers,
and an S3 bucket. Instances deployed are given specific roles to support OpenShift.
The Bastion host limits the external access to internal servers by insuring that
all SSH traffic passes through the Bastion host. The master instances host the
OpenShift master components such as etcd and the OpenShift API.  The Application
instances are for users to deploy their containers while the Infrastructure
instances are used for the OpenShift Router and Registry.  Authentication is managed
by Google OAuth.  OpenShift on AWS has two cloud native storage options; Elastic Block
Storage are used for the filesystem of instances but can also be used for persistent 
storage in containers.  The other storage option is S3 which is object based storage. 
S3 is used for the persistent storage of the OpenShift Registry.
