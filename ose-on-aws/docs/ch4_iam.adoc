====  _Identity and Access Management_

AWS provides IAM to securely control access to AWS services and resources for 
users. In this guide, IAM provides security for our admins creating the cluster
as well roles for the nodes to read and write to AWS S3 buckets, implementing
the <<Identity Management Service>>.

This reference architecture requires that we have a S3 and EBS policy.

For more information see https://aws.amazon.com/iam/

Two accounts will need to be created for OpenShift. One account will manage a S3 Bucket and the other will manage EBS volumes. The S3 bucket will be used for the registry while the other will be used for persistent storage.
