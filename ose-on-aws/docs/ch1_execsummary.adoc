== Executive Summary


Red Hat OpenShift 3 is built around a core of application containers powered by
Docker, with orchestration and management provided by Kubernetes, on a foundation
 of Atomic host and Enterprise Linux. OpenShift Origin is the upstream community
project that brings it all together along with extensions, to accelerate
application development and deployment.

This reference environment provides a comprehensive example demonstrating how
OpenShift 3 can be set up to take advantage of the native high availability
capabilities of Kubernetes and Amazon Web Services in order to create a highly
available OpenShift 3 environment. The configuration consists of three OpenShift
 masters, two OpenShift infrastructure nodes, two OpenShift application nodes,
and three Elastic Load Balancers to ensure high availabilty. In addition to 
the configuration, operational management tasks are shown to demonstrate functionality.
